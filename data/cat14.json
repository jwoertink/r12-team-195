{"name":"Crownarita","description":"The ingredients are nothing new, but the term Crownarita was coined at the Wirefly X-Prize Cup in Las Cruces New Mexico by two X-Prize Cup volunteers: Dan Baca and Sean O'Dell.  The drink was invented on the spot in the VIP tent when ingredients for a simple whiskey sour where not at hand.  Remarkably, the drink was an instant favorite and was being ordered by VIPs for the remainder of the event. Due to the nature of the X-Prize Cup event, many aerospace industry officials and rocket scientists were present. As such, the drink went through brief series of space related names including Laika Sour and Rocket Fuel before settling on the more descriptive name Crownarita.Combine ingredients and serve over ice in an old fashioned glass.

{"name":"Lips of Myristica","description":"This drink will bring you not only a spiritual experience over night and dreaming (if you sleep), but it will bring you the best entertainment the next day.\r\n\r\nHistory and Facts:   Over time, natives and other people have found out that nutmeg contains a hallucinogenic property known as Myristica.  Tribes used it as rituals to connect with spirits.  During modern day parties, people have used nutmeg and vodka together, even consuming both at different times.  You see, the effects of the nutmeg's \"trip\" or legal \"high\" takes place in up to 8 hours.  During the time before \"nutmeg trip\" is a spiritual sense and perspective.  Never use nutmeg in a spice form; not much will happen if you use nutmeg spice.  Use the nutmeg nuts.  Also, in order to bring out the hallucinogenic-trippy property,Myristica, you would need to consume nutmeg in large quantities, like 5 nuts or more.\r\n\r\nWhere to buy nutmeg nuts? You can find them at your local food store.  Walmart carries around 9 nutmeg nuts in a small plastic-glass container in the spice section.\r\n\r\nHave fun and be safe.Handle the nutmeg nuts first.  Take at least 4-5 nutmeg nuts and crush them up at much as possible.  Some advice would be using a food processor or maybe smashing them up with something around the kitchen.\r\n\r\nAfter the nutmegs are smashed up, put them in a blender (or whatever you prefer).\r\n\r\nThen put 3 shots of vodka in there to take out the nutmeg's flavor.  Any hard liquor does the trick.  Blend or shake till all is mixed well.\r\n\r\nAdd in the ginger ale as much to your liking.  Around 2 cups should do the trick, maybe even more.  \r\n\r\nAdd a shot of Malibu to bring a tropical hint.  Add a little bit of vanila extract (not important, but is suggested).  \r\n\r\nStir and mix well, settle down with ice in an old-fashioned glass.  If for some reason the nutmeg is still chunky, just consume it.  It's fine.","instructions":"Handle the nutmeg nuts first.  Take at least 4-5 nutmeg nuts and crush them up at much as possible.

The drink was then made famous in Eau Claire, WI on the UWEC campus, and is also a mainstay in the Eagle River, WI and Minneapolis, MN areas. In a pint sized glass filled with ice, pour the glass half full of vodka and then top with mix. Orange mixes best, with berry flavors also a favorable option.

I can't believe some of the things I've seen passed off as \"Spanish Coffee\" elsewhere, including on this site.  This is the real deal.  If you do not have tempered wine glasses, use a good heavy glass coffee mug.  Non-tempered thin glass WILL overheat and break.  Don't do it.Sugar the rim of a tempered Pinot glass.  Pour 1/2 shot Bacardi 151 rum.  Use candle lighter or match to flame the rum.  Turn glass repeatedly to allow flame to caramelize the sugar on the rim.  Don't melt it completely, just caramelize it.  While rum is still flaming, sprinkle cinnamon and nutmeg lightly into flame.  Add Kahlua, a splash of triple-sec, fill with fresh coffee, a bit of real whipped cream (not the spray gunk), then sprinkle a bit more cinnamon on the top.  The flame will probably go out when adding either the Kahlua or coffee, but if not, or if you are afraid the glass is becoming too hot, simply place a cocktail napkin over the glass for a second to smother the flame.","instructions":"Sugar the rim of a tempered Pinot glass.

{"name":"Talon","description":"Invented in 2007, by Josh Greenroyd in Chi. Although champagne is not generally accepted as a good mix with orange and tequila, it adds a sparkling edge to the drink which is a highly unusual sensation. \r\n\r\nA good Jose Golden Tequila is the better choice for this cocktail, bringing more flavour to it.  I'd recommend not using triple sec although it is the cheaper alternative - it doesn't give as much presence in the finished drink. \r\n\r\nThe quantities for the lime and lemon juice are not definate, as long as 1 oz of fresh juice is added - any less and the drink becomes heavy and cloggy. To give a more champagne-esque cocktail, remove 1 oz. of Tequila and 1/2 oz. Cointreau.  Double the quantity of champagne and serve in a chilled flute.Set a chilled Martini Glass down and rub a fresh lime wedge around the rim. \r\n\r\nFill a regular-sized cocktail shaker with a generous scoop of ice and pour in the tequila.  Leave it for 60 seconds; whilst this is happening, rim 1/2-3/4 of the chilled glass with sugar, taking care to tap off any excess.\r\n\r\nReturn to the shaker and add the Cointreau and Grand Marnier and stir vigourously, making sure they are combined.  Now add the fresh juice, top the shaker and shake vigourously until the shaker itself starts to frost.\r\n\r\nStrain the mixture into the glass, top off with the chilled champagne; finish by placing a small lime wedge into the drink, although this is optional.","instructions":"Set a chilled Martini Glass down and rub a fresh lime wedge around the rim. \r\n\r\nFill a regular-sized cocktail shaker with a generous scoop of ice and pour in the tequila.

{"name":"Vernon's Grog","description":"Grog has varied in strength throughout history, but vice-admiral Eward Vernon, the inventor of grog and a supporter of sailor's rights, first made grog with these measurements. At first, grog consisted of just rum and water, but it didn't take long for lemon juice and sugar to be added for flavor. It wasn't until 1851, roughly one hundred years after its invention, that other condiments were officially added.\r\nA sailor's daily ration of grog consisted of the equivalent of 8 double shots of whiskey.Pour the rum into the container of your choice. A mug is suggested if a hot beverage is desired, but a glass works for a cool drink. Real Jamaican rum has the strong flavor that's desired for grog. Add sugar. Brown sugar can work as a substitute; white sugar is too flavorless to work well. Add a good tablespoon of lemon juice. Add cool or boiling water, depending on choice. Stir until the sugar is dissolved.\r\n\r\nFor extra flavor, cinnamon, in the form of a stick or powder, can be added. One stick or a pinch of powdered cinnamon is sufficient.","instructions":"Pour the rum into the container of your choice.
