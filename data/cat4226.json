Pour 1/2 shot Bacardi 151 rum.  Use candle lighter or match to flame the rum.  Turn glass repeatedly to allow flame to caramelize the sugar on the rim.  Don't melt it completely, just caramelize it.  While rum is still flaming, sprinkle cinnamon and nutmeg lightly into flame.  Add Kahlua, a splash of triple-sec, fill with fresh coffee, a bit of real whipped cream (not the spray gunk), then sprinkle a bit more cinnamon on the top.  The flame will probably go out when adding either the Kahlua or coffee, but if not, or if you are afraid the glass is becoming too hot, simply place a cocktail napkin over the glass for a second to smother the flame.","instructions":"Sugar the rim of a tempered Pinot glass.
