{"name":"Borly","description":"Made by MMJ (Norway). So far, just a few know it. There might be similar ones out there, but atleast I gave it a name.\r\nBorly is short for \"Boris orly?\", and is inspired by Boris Yeltsin, a former Russian president, who was known for his drinking and anger. The drink is red, just like his face (and it reminds you of the old Sovjet regime).Fill the glass halfway up with ice. Then you pour around 3 oz of vodka, preferrably Boris Jelzin Vodka. Fill up the rest with the raspberry soda, and hopefully enjoy. \r\n\r\nYou need to make your own mix to like it. It does not hide the alcohol taste very well, and most of the vodka will probably sink downwards in the cocktail. If you find it too strong, use less vodka. Mint leaves could be a success, and lime too. \r\n\r\nYou could make it as a mojito, if you just replace the flavourless soda with the raspberry one, and adding some additional vodka along with the rum. Though, haven't tried that yet, leaving that to someone else.","instructions":"Fill the glass halfway up with ice. Then you pour around 3 oz of vodka, preferrably Boris Jelzin Vodka.

{"name":"Mint Mojito","description":"\"This drink comes from Cuba, where the produce is readily available. It's my favorite drink to have, upscale and unique. When you go out you'll find that most places won't make it because fresh mint is hard to come by, but if you're ever in the grocery store, check the produce section. If they have it try it out.\r\n\r\nIts a light, refreshing drink thats great to have poolside, or with anything. It cools that hot sticky feeling in your mouth, with smooth mint and tangy lime, its a great balance between bitter, sweet, and mint.\r\n\r\nYou can also try adding in other fresh fruits when you muddle, and use their  liquors or bitters to bring out their flavors.\r\n\r\nTry using fresh strawberries, or raspberries and raspberry vodka. \"In a highball glass, drop the limes, then mint, and add the sugar. \r\nMuddle together, but don't break down the mint too much, otherwise, You'll be sipping mint bits. If you don't have muddler, you can use a wooden spoon, or the bottom of an ice cream scoop handle. You want to basically crush the juice out of the limes, while using the sugar to grind against the limes and mint to release their oils and flavors. You're not trying to dissolve the sugar here.\r\n\r\nNext pour in the alcohol. I like grey goose because its particularly light, you can use whatever you have on hand, or use 3 oz of Barcardi Limon in place of the light rum and grey goose.\r\n\r\nSome people add the ice here, but I don't recommend it, because if you do, then the sugar is hard to dissolve, and you end up sipping grains of sugar, so rather, stir with a bartender's swizzle stick, or whatever you have on hand, don't shake though, cause it'll damage the mint, breaking it apart. \r\n\r\nOnce the sugar is dissolved (you can usually tell after about 20 vigorous stirs, or when you look at the bottom of the glass and see no sediment), and lots of ice, and top off with club soda, about 3 oz or just to the top.\r\n\r\nStir to mix in the club soda, and drop in a straw and enjoy!","instructions":"In a highball glass, drop the limes, then mint, and add the sugar. \r\nMuddle together, but don't break down the mint too much, otherwise, You'll be sipping mint bits.

However, it does differ from some of the more mundane cocktails of the same name in the fact that it is actually served in an Ottawa nightclub - Zaphod Beeblebrox - and tastes fantastic despite not being quite as potent as the recipes involving Everclear, Bacardi 151 and all that lark.

{"name":"Pompous Mexican","description":"The Pompous Mexican is a cocktail made from Corona beer, Tanqueray gin and lemon juice (ReaLemon brand is recommended). It's popular in New York Tri-State Area & San Francisco. The ingredients complement each other as the beer smooths out the gin, and the gin/lemon de-fizzes the beer.\r\n\r\nThis drink was created by Jon C. Hodgson in the summer of 2003. It was a hot summer, and he was alternating between icy Coronas and refreshing Gin & Tonics. One day he couldn't decide which one to have, so he simply combined the two (mostly... admittedly he left out the tonic altogether).1. Take a sip (or pour out) a small amount of the Corona, down to where the neck widens, creating room for the other ingredients.\r\n2. Carefully pour the Tanqueray & lemon juice into the bottle of Corona.\r\n3. Cap the bottle tightly with your thumb, invert until the ingredients mix fully.\r\n4. Drink and enjoy.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n* The Corona should be cold (from a refrigerator).\r\n* While not required, the lemon juice should be cold (from a refrigerator) and the Tanqueray should be chilled (in a freezer).\r\n* \"More\" is not \"better\" - Using more than a half shot of gin or lemon will ruin the flavor.\r\n* Gins vary widely in flavor. While other gins can be used, the original gin used by the creator is Tanqueray.\r\n* Don't use lime as a substitute for lemon.","instructions":"1.
