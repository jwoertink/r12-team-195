It's popularity is believed to come from the usage of Champagne or lack thereof which for many drinkers in their early to mid 20's perceived as a classy drink that down right tasted good. Although that T.G.I. Friday's is no longer there (you can find Tom Baron bartending @ Harry's on E street between 11th and 12th streets NW across from the ESPN Zone), the Bone Crusher is still a favorite for most inner-city socialites throughout the Metropolitan area and can be found in any Restaurant/Bar in and outside the Capital Beltway.Combine all ingredients (except Champagne) in a cocktail shaker and shake vigorously.
